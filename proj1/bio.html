<h1>About</h1>
<div id="box">
<p>Even though New Jersey was my first home, I've come to appreciate the whole world
as a neighborhood- mine to explore. I love to travel and I see first hand experience
as the most successful learning tool. My hope is to travel the world and understand
its diverse peoples.</p>
<p>As a sophomore at Tufts University, I am pursuing my interests in a variety of
fields. My love for Latin America directs much of my coursework towards that region.
I hope to live in South America post graduation.</p>
<p>As a curious freshman, I discovered computer science. My love of problem solving
and fascination with the new possibilities programming opened drew me to the field. 
This openness to new ideas is the same characteristic that drives me to learn and
understand new things each day.
